## Description 

Refactoring a Book Search Engine from using a RESTful API to setting up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify the data! I added a few files and reworked the code that was given to me in the assignment README. I set up MongoDB Atlas and connected it to my Heroku and I still could not get it to deploy. Ill include screenshots of my code and all of the build log errors. 

## Installation 

Nothing to install but the repository is in my GitHub: github.com/snerowski 

## Usage 
There is not a lot of usage, but I added the necessary files in the backend and set everything up to define the query and mutation type and added the necessary code to to implement the Apollo server. Also created the front end files queries.js and mutations.js to handle everything with the Apollo server. Also made all the changes in the App.js, SearchBooks.js, SignupForm.js, and the LoginForm.js files.
